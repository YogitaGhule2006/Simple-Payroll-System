# Simple Payroll System

## 1. Project Title
**Simple Payroll System (Clarity Smart Contract)**

## 2. Project Description
The Simple Payroll System is a minimal Clarity smart contract that allows an administrator (contract owner) to register employees and assign them monthly salaries in STX, and then directly pay them from the contract balance. Itâ€™s designed to demonstrate a basic on-chain payroll mechanism with only two core functions.

## 3. Project Vision
Our vision is to simplify payroll distribution on the Stacks blockchain by enabling direct, transparent, and immutable salary transactions. The goal is to reduce administrative complexity and increase trust between employers and employees.

## 4. Future Scope
- **Automated Payments:** Schedule salary disbursements based on block height or date.
- **Multi-Admin Support:** Allow multiple payroll managers with role-based permissions.
- **Employee Self-Service:** Enable employees to withdraw their own salaries when due.
- **Token Payments:** Extend to support fungible token salaries (not just STX).
- **Detailed History:** Maintain a record of all salary payments for transparency.
